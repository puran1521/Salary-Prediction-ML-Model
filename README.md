# Salary-Prediction-ML-Module
Skill Based Project-AIML

## Overview
This project outlines the steps for creating and evaluating a Salary Prediction Machine Learning Model. It includes code snippets, outputs, and visualizations to guide users through the process of importing libraries, loading datasets, splitting data into training and test sets, creating a linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

## Prerequisites
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- sklearn.model
- sklearn.linear_model
- pandas
- numpy

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is 'salary.csv', which contains columns like 'Age', 'Years of Experience', and 'Salary'.

## Steps
1. **Importing Libraries**: Import the necessary Python libraries.
2. **Loading Dataset**: Load the dataset from the CSV file.
3. **Splitting Dataset**: Split the dataset into training and test sets.
4. **Creating Model**: Create a linear regression model.
5. **Evaluating Model**: Evaluate the performance of the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
6. **Predicting Salary for given age**: Provide an example using specific age input to predict the corresponding salary.
7. **Visualizing Training Set Results**: Include scatter plots to visualize training set results and test set results respectively; both have lines indicating predicted salaries across different ages.

## Results
The final linear regression model is represented by an equation with coefficients values displayed at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook.
